How to prepare for software engineer interviews – FAANG

Part 1: DS/Algo Problem Solving

If you are planning to get interviewed at any of the FAANG companies, you must master the problem-solving rounds, aka Data structures & Algorithms rounds. Some companies will have a screening round in which they will ask 1 or 2 questions in 45 minutes to 60 minutes round. So, without having a firm grip over the concepts and an acceptable speed and accuracy, you won’t be able to enter the full loop of interviews, as all these signals decide whether the interviewer will pass you or fail you in the screening round. Also, once you clear the screening round, you will face 2-3 rounds of problem-solving again. So, naturally, it’s the first thing you need to master to enter the full loop of interviews.
What does the complete hiring process look like?

1. Apply on the company’s career website, LinkedIn (or any other job website), or via referral.
2. If your profile gets shortlisted, you might get a call from the recruiter or directly you will either receive a link to complete an online test or there will be a screening round.
3. Once you pass the online test/screening interview, you will get a call from the recruiter explaining the remaining interviews, aka full loop interviews.
4. The final loop will have 2-3 problem-solving rounds, 1 behavioral round, and 1 system design round. Some companies also ask low-level design and that is classified as a problem-solving round. In most cases, you will have a choice to schedule the interviews on the same day or divide them into 2-3 days.
5. After that you will get the final results in 2-10 days. If you don’t hear back from the recruiter, remind them to share the results. Even if you think the interviews didn’t go well, you should always demand feedback as it will make you aware of the areas you need improvement. Also, knowing in which areas you excelled in the interviews will increase your self-confidence and morale for the next interviews.
